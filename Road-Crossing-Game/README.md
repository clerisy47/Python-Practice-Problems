# Road-Crossing-Game
This is a road crossing game built from scratch using the turtle module in Python. The game includes different levels of difficulty, providing a fun and challenging experience for players of all skill levels.

# Getting-Started
To play the game, simply clone or download the repository and run the main.py file using Python. Make sure you have the turtle module installed on your machine.

# Gameplay
The objective of the game is to safely cross the road without getting hit by any cars. Use the arrow keys to move your character across the road. The speed and number of cars will increase as you progress through the levels, making it more difficult to reach the other side.

# Levels
The game includes multiple levels with increasing difficulty. Each level presents new challenges and obstacles that players must overcome in order to progress.

# Built-With
Python - The programming language used
Turtle - The Python library used for the game's graphics
