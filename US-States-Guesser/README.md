# US-States-Guesser
This project is a simple python program that quizzes the user on the names of the 50 states in the United States. The program uses the turtle library to display an image of the United States, and allows the user to enter the names of the states they know. The program also keeps track of the states the user has missed and writes them to a CSV file.

# Requirements
Python 3
Pandas

# Usage
Run the program using python3 main.py
A window will open displaying the image of the United States and a text input asking for the name of a state.
Enter the name of a state and press enter. If the state is correct, it will be written on the image at its corresponding location.
Continue guessing states until you have found all 50 or you choose to exit.
The program will then write a CSV file named "missed_states.csv" containing the states you missed.

# Customization
The program uses a CSV file named "50_states.csv" that contains the state names and their corresponding x, y coordinates on the image. You can customize this file to change the location of the states or add new states.
The program uses a gif image named "blank_states_img.gif" as the background image. You can replace this image with your own image of the United States.

# Note
Please make sure that the CSV and image files are in the same directory as the main.py file, otherwise the program will not run as expected.
