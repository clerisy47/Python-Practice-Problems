# Pong-Game
This is a multiplayer Pong game built using Python's turtle module. The game features two paddles that can be controlled by the players using the "w" and "s" keys for the left paddle and the "Up" and "Down" keys for the right paddle. The game also includes a ball that bounces off the walls and the paddles, and a scoreboard that keeps track of the scores.

The game can be run by executing the main.py file.

# Code-Structure
The code for the game consists of four main files:

ball.py: This file defines the Ball class, which inherits from the Turtle class. The class includes methods for moving the ball, bouncing off the walls and the paddles, and resetting the ball to its initial position.

paddle.py: This file defines the Paddle class, which also inherits from the Turtle class. The class includes methods for moving the paddle up and down.

scoreboard.py: This file defines the Scoreboard class, which keeps track of the scores of the two players.

main.py: This file creates the game screen, creates instances of the Paddle, Ball, and Scoreboard classes, and sets up the game loop that updates the screen and handles the game logic.

# Customization
The game can be customized by modifying the values of certain variables in the code. For example, the size of the screen can be changed by modifying the setup() method in the main.py file. The speed of the ball can be changed by modifying the speed attribute of the Ball class in the ball.py file.

# Dependencies
This game requires Python 3 and the turtle module to run.

# Built-With
