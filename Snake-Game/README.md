# Snake-Game
This is a Snake Game implemented using the turtle library in python. The game is similar to the classic Snake game found on the Nokia mobile phones. 
The game screen is surrounded by a maze and the snake can move left, right, up and down using the corresponding arrow keys. 
The snake grows in size as it eats food, and the score is displayed on the top of the screen.

#Getting-Started
To run the game, you need to have Python3 and turtle library installed on your computer.
Clone or download the repository on your computer and navigate to the folder where the files are located.

Run the command python main.py

# How-to-Play

Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement and guide it to eat the food. The food is represented by blue circles that appear randomly on the screen. Every time the snake eats food, it grows in size and the score is increased by 1.
The game is over when the snake collides with the walls of the maze or its own body. The high score is recorded and displayed on the top of the screen.

# Files-in-the-Repository
